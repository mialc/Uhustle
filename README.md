# Uhustle — Student Opportunity Hub (iOS prototype)

**Uhustle** is a lightweight, student-first hub for quick jobs, gigs, clubs, and campus events.  
Instead of competing with Instagram/LinkedIn, Uhustle **redirects** you to the right place fast
(IG, LinkedIn, Google Forms, etc.). It’s a **utility launcher** for opportunities.

## 🔗 Try the Prototype
Figma (view-only): https://www.figma.com/design/ap5YHXlfq4FHcYbN5Eoubj/Uhustle-Protype?node-id=0-1&t=8X47EPz74wEuYDr4-1

## ✨ Why it exists
Students constantly ask “anyone hiring?” across countless group chats and IG stories.
Official tools (Handshake/LinkedIn) are slow or geared toward long-term roles.  
Uhustle fills the gap for **day-of gigs, quick cash shifts, and campus involvement**.

## 🧭 MVP Features (prototype)
- Feed of cards (Jobs • Gigs • Internships • Clubs • Events)
- One-tap **Apply/Join** → redirects to the correct app/site
- Simple posting form (Title, Category, Link, Description)
- Clean iOS visual language (notch-safe, icon-only bottom nav)

## 🧪 Research (snapshot)
- Students rely on **GroupMe/Discord/IG** for fast gigs → info gets lost
- Need a **central launcher** that filters noise and sends you to the right link

## 🛣 Roadmap
- Verified posters (.edu sign-in)
- Push notifications for new gigs in your category
- Employer/student ratings for trust and safety
- Optional payments flow (Venmo/Zelle link-out)

## 🛠 Tech & Tools
- **Design**: Figma (iOS frames, Auto Layout)
- **Target**: iOS (icon-only bottom nav, notch-safe header)
- **Future build**: React Native or Swift/SwiftUI
